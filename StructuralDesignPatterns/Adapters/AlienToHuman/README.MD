Our goals here is to make the Alien class like a "human".
Ok, ok, you see it. We try to do an Alien invasion!

We perfect now, that the alien body is also complicated as a human one, so "modificate" it naturally is a enormous problem. But we can do an adapter.

The problem is to make an integration of Alien entity in any place, where we wait a human one. But we can't change both classes.

Ideal for `adapter` pattern, isn't it?
