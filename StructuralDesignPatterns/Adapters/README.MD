## Adapter

Primary design goal was to adapt one class behaviour to an another, which have basically a different interface.
So, we have two different class at the start, and suddenly a connecting requirement happen. We should use two different class together, but we haven't a clear opporunity (or doesn't have totallly) to modificate one of both classes.

You know, that change an already created code is a bad idea, and, of course, change good code is obvious a terrible idea.

That's why `adapter` has been introduce.
