You are a director. Of a big IT company. Suppose it.

And you create lot of products, like web-app, desktop app or server-hosted high-load app.

Anyway, you don't want to `if-else` you code again (because you are busy to the extreme), so you look for a reasonable way to structure it in the code.

Every product have two entities, that can be create on the hosted product:

- `Agent` - a logger;
- `Optimizer` - an optimizer ML-based software.

> P.S. I was absolutely confused for the difference between this pattern and `factory method`.
